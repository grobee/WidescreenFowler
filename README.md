# Widescreen Fowler

## Introduction
It always bugged me that there is no widescreen support on [martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com).
This Chrome extensions makes the text **readable** by making [martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com) centered on widescreen displays.

## Installation
Just follow the official Google Chrome docs.
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest

## Licence
Free of use. I have not published it to the official Chrome Extension Store because it would require **5 USD** to register.
I simply did not want to spend that kind of money just to be able to publish a single extension.
